# Etch-a-sketch
(input) grid

well its incomplete, will have to come back later with more info

update*******
i did not understand the task fully i.e using a mouse trial to create a sketch effect instead of a simple event by the mouse entering a div and changing the color.

also understood the grid stacking issue by using a loop inside a loop to create equal rows and columns and used the dimensions of the square container to get the dimension of each grid, also removing padding and gap so that the divs fit equally into the container.
